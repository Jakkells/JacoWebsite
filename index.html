          <p class="intro">
            As a passionate web developer, I am constantly inspired by the ever-evolving 
            world of technology. My love for learning and desire to stay at the forefront 
            of my field led me to pursue a BSc in IT at Eduvos. I am dedicated to creating 
            visually stunning, user-friendly websites that provide a seamless experience for
            users. I am excited to continue honing my skills and bringing new ideas to the 
            table in my work as a web developer.

            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>
            I have a strong foundation in programming languages such 
            as Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I am proficient 
            in using frameworks such as Bootstrap and have experience 
            working with databases using SQL. My technical skills are 
            continually expanding as I actively seek out new challenges 
            and opportunities to improve my abilities.

              "I'm a multitasking ninja with a dash of critical thinking, a pinch of 
              patience, a good dose of self-awareness, and a hefty serving of 
              accountability. Add in a sprinkle of adaptability, a smidge of time 
              management, and an open-minded outlook and you've got the recipe for 
              my versatile skill set."
